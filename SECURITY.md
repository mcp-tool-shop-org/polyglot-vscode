## Scope

Polyglot VS Code is a local translation extension. Its threat model covers:

- **Data privacy** — all translation is local via Ollama, no data leaves the machine
- **Ollama communication** — connects only to localhost by default (`http://localhost:11434`)
- **File operations** — creates translated files alongside originals, never overwrites

## What This Extension Does NOT Do

- No cloud API calls (all processing is local GPU via Ollama)
- No data collection or telemetry
- No network requests except to local Ollama server
- No secrets or credentials in the codebase
