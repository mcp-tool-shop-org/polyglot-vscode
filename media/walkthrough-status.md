## Prerequisites

Polyglot runs translation **entirely on your machine** — no API keys, no cloud, no data leaving your system.

You need:

1. **Ollama** installed and running — [download here](https://ollama.com)
2. **TranslateGemma** model pulled — the extension does this automatically on first use

### Quick check

Look at the status bar (bottom-right). You should see:

- `$(globe) Polyglot` — everything is ready
- `$(warning) Polyglot` — Ollama isn't running (click to start it)
- `$(cloud-download) Polyglot` — model needs to be downloaded
